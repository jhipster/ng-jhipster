## Development setup

You need NodeJS and NPM.

### Fork the ng-jhipster project

Go to the [ng-jhipster project](https://github.com/jhipster/ng-jhipster) and click on the "fork" button. You can then clone your own fork of the project, and start working on it.

[Please read the Github forking documentation for more information](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Build

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Make some changes, run `npm run test` to run both tslint and unit tests.

Build the library with `npm run build`.

Package the library by running `npm pack` in the `dist` directory. This will create an archive `ng-jhipster-vX.Y.Z.tgz`.

For testing, you will want to integrate this archive into an application generated by JHipster.

Go to your generated JHipster application and run...

    npm install path/to/ng-jhipster/dist/ng-jhipster-vX.Y.Z.tgz

...so that your JHipster application uses the content of this archive as `ng-jhipster` dependency which is located in `node_modules/ng-jhipster`.
